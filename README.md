I assume you have the following libraries installed
# std C libraries
# POSIX 2011 libraries (includes std C)
# LibC (or BSD-libc) (includes POSIX)
Generally for Mac and Linux OS's these come installed out of the box.
But to be safe you may want to grab GNU GCC, it comes with POSIX, BSD-LibC is an additional install
